CORS
=====

## Overview

Cross-Origin calls poses a security risk for the users. 
A malicious website can attempt to steal the user data by initiating a call
from the user browser.

    Client --> Server

The protection is a client enforcement that happens only in the browser. It does not impact Desktop clients (eg, Postman) or Mobile apps.

* Access-Control-Allow-Origin

The simple case is GET or HEAD with no Header. It only requires to validate the Origin.

## Pre-flight

If GET or HEAD method contains additional Headers in the call, then it requires 
to request a pre-authorization. It is an OPTION request (also called pre-flight)
using Access-Control-Request-Headers.

*  Access-Control-Allow-Headers

If the request method is POST, PUT, PATCH, ... then it is required to check the method.

* Access-Control-Allow-Methods

## Responses

In all responses, you should see the following results:

* Access-Control-*

It will declare the following items:

* Origin
* Headers
* Methods
